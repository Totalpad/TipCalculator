The Eat and Split app is a simple React-based application designed to help you split expenses with your friends after dining out. It allows you to add friends, keep track of who owes what, and easily split bills among your group. Whether you're at a restaurant, cafe, or any food joint, this app simplifies the process of settling bills with friends.

## Features
